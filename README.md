### Experience Cornwall Logo

## **What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?**
This is my second milestone project where I have designed, created and built a mobile-first, fully responsive and interactive website for 
experiencing the county of Cornwall, England. My goals with this website are to share the uniqueness of what Cornwall has to offer, inspiring
people to visit and learn about its history of Cornish mining, sea fishing, culture and heritage. 

I have taken my knowledge learned from the first five modules of the Full Stack Web Developer course, (HTML, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend 
Development, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development Modules) to provide a clear, functioning and responsive website that 
demonstrates a proficient use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The Bootstrap Framework was used along side these programming languages to help give
the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site is as responsive as possible for use across various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet and
mobile. The jQuery framework was used amoungst my own JavaScript code for easier implementation of some code.


## **User Experience**
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/response.png" alt="Experience Cornwall Am I Responsive image"></div>

#### User Stories:

* User Goals:
    * As a user, I want to be able to navigate through the entire site, comfortably and securely.
    * As a user, I want to be able to easily contact the site with any initial queires that I may have, submit questions, and recieve an
    acknowledgement of my message being received, and a due response.
    * As a user, I want to learn more about the county of Cornwall and its history, and what can be seen and done there. This includes information
    such as where to eat and where to stay.
    * As a user, I want to be able to follow links from 'Experience Cornwall' to the website of interest (i.e. hotel or activity own's website).
    * As a user, I want to learn how to make a traditional Cornish pasty and be given clear guidance on how make my own should I wish to do so.
    * As a user, I want to feel comfortable and informed about visiting Cornwall.
    * As a user, I want to be able to access the site's social media accounts in order to learn more.
    
* For the user, the site assists in meeting the user goals by:
    * Presenting a clean website that's easy-on-the-eye, providing smooth navigation with the use of a fixed navbar that changes to a solid
    opacity as the user scrolls. This enables them to click between the pages at all times. The user can also click on the logo from
    any page to take them back to the home page.
    * Providing a clean, basic form that doesn't overwhelm or confuse the user which they can fill out to submit any questions they may have.
    Upon submission the user gets a modal pop up providing them with feedback that their query has been submitted successfully, and an invitation
    to check their entered email for confirmation.
    * Tells a story of the hisory of Cornwall upon the initial loading of the site. The experience page showcases a Google Map with clickable buttons
    and drops markers on the map. The user can then click the markers and learn more about what Cornwall has to offer.
    * Once clicking on the buttons available, the user can click through the markers that pop up. Once a marker is selected, the user can click on
    a link to the corresponding website. The beach locations are the only set of locations that do not contain a clickable website as not all
    beaches have their own website.
    * Also upon clicking the buttons linked to the map, three cards are presented below the map as 'Top 3 Recommendations'. These cards contain an
    image, a short sentence and a button inviting the user to find out more, which will direct the user to the coresponding website.
    * An embedded YouTube video shows, informs and teaches the user how to make a Traditional Cornish pasty.
    * The footer contains all the social media links the user will need to use for follwing and learning more about this site.

#### Design
##### 1. Colour Scheme

I chose colors that would be soothing and calming on first glance of the website, and not intrusive. The muted tones give the page a serene look
and feel. This was important to me as my aim was to create an online space that promotes and represents a feeling of what colours can be found
throughout Cornwall, from the shades of blue in the ocean to the rolling greens of the countryside, and golds of soft sand beaches.

Colours I used are:

* DFE8F1 - Alice Blue - Primary Colour
* F8E5D0 - Antique White - Secondary Colour
* 01A1B1 - Viridian Green - Accent Colour
* 61999E - Cadet Blue - Button Hover Colour
* 000000 - Black - Text Colour
* FFFFFF - White - Navbar on Scroll Colour

The primary colour, Alice Blue (DFE8F1), was used throughout the pages to give the whole site consistency. I used a coloured background after
receiving feedback from my Milestone 1 Project about having the majority of text on a white background. I found that it gives the page a nicer
overall feeling and makes the text less harsh on the eye and therefoere easier to read.<br>
I made the navbar transparent until the user scrolls below a set amount of pixels. At this point the navbar turns White (FFFFFF) showing a clear
contrast between the navbar and the rest of the page and ensures the text of the navbar isn't marred by any background images. This allows the user
to easily read and use the navbar for navigation around the site.<br>
The secondary colour, Antique White (F8E5D0), was used only in the footer to give a sense of the beaches and golden sand. This broke away well
from the rest of the page, making it clear to the user that they are at the bottom of the page. It also worked well with the rest of the
colours used on the page, complimenting them and feeding into the beachy feel I wanted to create.<br>
Throughout the site, I used Viridian Green (01A1B1) as my accent colour. This colour was pulled from the ocean of the hero image used on my home
page. I used this colour for all headings, all buttons across the pages, the back-to-top button, the social links in the footer, and any active
text, i.e. the current page the user is on. I then took this colour and made it a slighlty darker shade, Cadet Blue (61999E), to be used when all of
the buttons were hovered over to provide the user and let them know they are able to interact with a button.<br>
I opted for Black (00000) as my text colour to make sure all the words clear and easy to read. As stated above, the headers and the current active
page shown on the navbar where the accent colour.

##### 2. Font

I decided to use two fonts throught my site. I included these fonts by inserting an _import_ link of Google Fonts API into the top of my 
style.css.<br>
The font I chose for the body text on the pages was 'Raleway', with a fall back of 'Sans-serif' should the site not load the import correctly. I
found the 'Raleway' font was clear, easy to read and fed into the simple, minimal look and feel I was trying to achieve with the site.<br>
The second font I used was 'Lato', again with the fallback of 'Sans-serif'. I used this for anything I wanted to stand out a little more as I felt
it had a more structured, bold format. This included the navbar, footer, headlines, sub-headings, buttons and forms. I used this font for all
of the form as I felt that with basic content it didn't need different fonts. Overall, I wanted a font that complemented the body text without
being wildly different from it. This would have made the page too busy and drawn attention away from the beautiful, peace-invoking imagery it was
sitting alongside. Clarity was key and the combination of Raleway and Lato helped me achieve that objective.
When it came to font weight, between the two fonts, I varied between 300 and 500 for differnt factors across the pages. 400 took precendent as the
average font weight, and then card heads were given 500 to stand out more. Whereas, the page headings, info window headings, and modal content
looked best with using 300.

##### 3. Logo

The logo was created using an online design tool called Canva. I created a custom canvas to fit my required dimensions and set the background to
be transparent as I was using a transparent navbar. When it came to designing the logo I wanted a symbol that represented Cornwall, and decided
that an engine house is the embodiment of Cornish culture. I selected the engine house from Google's selection of free images and played with the
contrast and saturation to turn it into a silhouette that would stand out clearly against the transparent/white background of the navbar. It also
matched the black font of the logo "Experience Cornwall". I chose the font 'Lato' for this text to match the font used for headings throughout the
site, keeping a clear consistency. It suited the site's branding and complemented all my other design choices well. 

##### 4. Composition

There is a clear structure throughout the site. Each of the main pages has a hero image at the top to engage the user. I also implemented content
hinting on all the pages to encourage scrolling and more user interaction. 
To help me keep the design neat and consistent, I had all content displayed central, with good margins for desktop use to avoid anything being cut
off the screen. I ensured all the content is full width for mobile sizes, utilising all of the space available. I found that having to scroll down
the home page made it feel like the story was unfolding which I thought was a nice touch. The Google map on the expereince page has been set to full
width to keep the map easily readable across all screen sizes. I made use of the 'Rule of Thirds" in the 'Top 3 Recommendations' section to help
draw the viewer's eye into the composition, rather than just glancing at the center.

##### 5. Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created using Figma. I initially sketched rough ideas down on paper and then further constructed them on the 
computer using Figma to create a more detailed mockup. The final pages I ended up with on the website did not vary too much from the wireframes I
made during the planning stages. Find the links to these wireframes below:

* [Home Page Wireframe](https://github.com/Gregory4321/milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/wire-home.png)

## **Features**

#### Existing Features

* Navbar - Featured across all pages. Site visitors can use the links on the left to navigate between all pages on the website. These links also
collapse down into a hamburger icon at smaller screen sizes. The logo, found on the left, can be clicked on all pages to take users back to the
home page. The navbar is also fixed, which enables the user to easily navigate between the pages of the website. The navbar starts off as transparent,
and then becomes white as the user scrolls to ensure it is always clear and legible.

* Footer - Also featured across all pages. Users will find clickable social icons linking to the corresponding social media pages.

* Hero images -  These can be found across the three main pages (History, Experience and Contact), and provide a visual reference to what the user
can expect to find and experience in Cornwall.

* Home Page - This page showcases a beginner's guide to Cornwall, teaching and informing the user about the history of Cornwall. It contains
corresponding images to the story being told, and an embedded YouTube video that will help the user learn how to make a Cornish pasty.

* Experience Page - This page was created to help the user understand what Cornwall has to offer. It makes use of Google Maps API, incorporating
clickable buttons above the map to make the user interact with the map. On the click of each button, markers will drop on the map, and then the
markers themselves once clicked will open an info window. The info windows contain information on each location such as the name and
address of the placed marker. The info windows also showcase a phone number and a clickable link to a corresponding website (other than the beach
locations which didn't have websites). I felt the user would be overwhelmed if the map presented them with every single beach, restaurant, hotel
etc. so I used my own extensove knowledge of Cornwall to help me hand pick the best locations in each category. I felt this added to the user
expereince because it meant the map would be clearer and provide them with a more streamlined set of recommendations.<br>
Also, upon clicking each button, 'Top 3 Recommendations' will appear below the map for each category. These are presented as cards, with images at
the head and then brief descriptions and/or encouraging statements followed by clickable buttons to the corresponding websites. I felt this added
a personal touch and gave the user encouragement when choosing what and where to visit on their trip to Cornwall.<br>
I had an issue with the positioning of my markers that I wasn't able to solve. All of the markers' coordinates were pulled from the respective
locations on Google Maps. However, once they were set and zoomed in on, I noticed that all my markers were positioned slighlty to the left of each
location. Through talks with tutor support, it concluded that this may be due to some default code written for Google Maps. I did attempt to
override it using various techniques that I found during my research, but I was ultimately unable todo so. That being said, it does not prove to be
a major issue for my site as the location coordinates I set match the 'true' positon of the locations' coordinates.

* Contact Page - This page provides a form users can fill out to contact the site. They can use this for general enquiries. Once the user submits
the form, they will be presented with a modal pop up thanking them for their message and informing them to check their email account. They're also
made aware that a response will be with them shortly. This provides the user with feedback that the query has gone through successfully. It is
important to provide feedback to the user so they feel their actions have been validated.<br>
I used the word 'Dreckly', which is a Cornish colloquialism that implies something will be done 'Directly' i.e. 'soon'. I did include in brackets
next to the word 'Dreckly' that this means 'Directly', so the user does not feel confused about the terminology.

* Back-to-Top Button - Each page contains a back-to-top button that will appear when the user scrolls to a set pixel height down the page, giving
the user easier navigation around the pages and the site. 

* Favicon Icon - When the user loads the web pages, a favicon image of the logo for Experience Cornwall appears in the tab at the top next to the
name of the site.

#### Future Features

* On the home/hisory page, I'd like to create a quiz that the user can take part in to test their knowledge about Cornwall after reading the
'Beginner's Guide To Cornwall'.

* Display a clickable icon as a link to a forum page where the user can dicsuss Cornwall further with other friendly visitors.

* Gallery Page - A seperate page to showcase images of Cornwall and visitors' experiences of the range of activities, beach walks etc. on offer.
This would give the user a more concrete idea of what to expect from a visit to Cornwall.

* Include more markers and information to give the user an even more extensive view of what Cornwall has to offer.

* On the scroll of the page, the hero image would zoom in.

## **Credits**

#### Content

All content on the website was written by me, the developer, with inspiration taken from other travel and informational sites. 

#### Code

* The code throughout the project used [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) as its base to create a
responsive site, utilising the Bootstrap grid system.

* Inspiration on how to place and style the hero images, as well as the cards used in the Top 3 Recommendations, was taken from my previous
Milestone 1 Project.

* Tutor support provided me with pointers and curve balls that helped me within the maps.js file to get started with my markers and understand how
best to implement my code.

* The code for the EmailJS was a mixture of using the documentation found on the website, following the CI tutorial videos on EmailJS, and my own
knowledge and practice put into place.

* The navbar-opacity-on-scroll code and the back-to-top button code was found on 'Codepen', and then tailored to my sites needs.

* The YouTube video embedded on the home page was taken from YouTube using the import from the share screen, and the iframe tag inserted. I want to
highlight that this video is being used for training purposes, and does not infringe copyright or ownership of the video.

* All other code was written by me, the developer.

#### Media

The images used on the website were taken from various different image libraries:

* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

* [Pixbay](https://pixabay.com/)

* [Google Images](https://google.com)

These images were then resized to suit the wants of me, the developer, using these two sites:

* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

* [Picresize](https://picresize.com/)

The logo image was created and exported to my computer using the site [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

The favicon image was created and exported to my computer using the site [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and then uploaded to the site [Favicon.io]
(https://favicon.io/) to be generated as an ico image, to then be exported back to my computer and then added to my root directory on gitpod.

The embedded video on the home page was imported using the iframe tag taken from online video-sharing platform:

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
