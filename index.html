            <p class="para-text">Picturesque coastlines and the rugged rolling countryside that await you on the Cornish peninsula provide the perfect 
                escape. But the Duchy’s beauty is by no means only skin deep. Buried beneath the earth lay an abundance of riches that the Cornish folk of 
                the 18th and 19th century mined and excavated to prosperous ends. Its horizons are dotted with old engine houses that were once buzzing with 
                workers hoping to strike copper, tin, or zinc in the depths below. The copper trade boomed with the dawn of the industrial revolution and, by 
                the 19th century, Cornwall had become the world’s main source of the metal. In fact, Gwennap near Redruth was known as the ‘richest square mile 
                on earth.’ A quick jaunt along the coast of west Cornwall will leave you marvelling at the sight of abandoned chimneys and mine shafts and the 
                prosperous history they represent.

            <p class="para-text">If you thought Cornwall’s industry ended at the water’s edge you’d be mistaken. Surrounded on three sides by the 
                Atlantic ocean, the sea and all its rewards have been part of Cornish culture since day dot. From fishing for salted pilchards to the 
                unlawful wrecking trade that was rife in years gone by, the stunning Cornish coastlines have always been a magnet for food, bounty and 
                trade. Its countless concealed coves and inlets made it a hot spot for smuggling goods from all over europe. Wreckers would also send out 
                false signals to ships, sending many a sailor to their watery grave, but providing riches for any looters willing to take the chance. 
                Nowadays, Cornwall’s coastal exploits mainly involve fishing and the abundance of beautiful produce the rich waters have to offer would 
                inspire any foody. Championed by the likes of celebrity chef Rick Stein and a hotspot for Michelin star cuisine, Cornwall’s fish stocks 
                have more than earned their place on the culinary map.

            <p class="para-text">Speaking of food, we couldn’t fail to mention the infamous Cornish pasty. Loved for centuries by locals and appreciated 
                worldwide for its humble flavours, this steaming pastry parcel has become the county’s national dish. Unsurprisingly, Cornish folk are 
                precious about their pasties and, as such, the delicacy was awarded Protected Geographical Indication in 2011. In order to be called a 
                ‘Cornish pasty,’ said baked good must be made in the shape of a D, with the curved edge crimped. It must contain nothing more than beef, 
                onion, potato, swede and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Oh, and it must be prepared in Cornwall. Take a look at the video below if you want 
                to have a go at imitating the tasty treat in your own kitchen...
